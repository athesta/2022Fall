# Requirements

## Purpose
In this assignment, we will set up a program that tracks the members of the cast of a TV show.

## Instructions
**1.** Use the `Actor`, `Cast`, and `Role` classes in the edu.uwex.apc390.lesson2_3 package (you can find the code package on the same page as the presentation).

**2.** Create a class called `CastList` with these data members:
* A private array of up to 5 Role objects
* Any other data members you may need

**3.** And these methods:
* A method to add a `Role` object
* A method to delete a `Role` object
* A `toString` method that will print out the number of roles and the details of each role including the actor’s name and the character’s name

**4.** In the `main` method of the `Cast` class:
* print your name using `System.out` at the start of the program
* create a `CastList` object and
* add the roles we have have been using to this `CastList` object and
* print the entire `CastList` object.

**5.** In a Word document, explain whether a class like `CastList` should use Aggregation or Composition and why.

## Submission Instructions
Once you are done with the assignment, submit a .jar file containing the source code (the .java files and any input files
